<h1 align = center>Project 2 Artificial-Vision</h1>

This repository contains the archives for the second project of the subject of Artificial Vision of the degree in Telecommunications Engineering. <br /> <br />
* With this practice, it is intended to reinforce the knowledge acquired, in relation to the calibration of cameras and the use of the equations 
of projection of points in the image. Starting from a previously calibrated camera and a reference template, corresponding to a simple flat object,
it is intended to superimpose another virtual object on top of said base, also simple, which must be placed, at all times, 
in a fixed position and orientation. , with respect to said reference base. <br />

## Requirements
The code is written in MATLAB R2021b. You can execute the code in this MATALB version or later.

## Instructions

### 1. Download the repository with the subject and the MATLAB code.

### 2. Execute the code in MATLAB. You first have to run the file umbralizacionRef.m and, later, the file practica2.m. 
You can change the image to use in the first file, or you can create your own figure. I encourage you to test different configurations!!
